### NOTE: Run the Server to view Skills

This is a portfolio site for Omar Garcia. You need to have two terminals open to run this effectively. First, run the mock backend with `npm run server` to view, add, or delete skills (runs on Port 5000). Second run with `ng serve` or `ng serve --open` and navigate to Port 4200.

You can welcomed to a simple summary. And from there you can view another sections. Happy browsing!
